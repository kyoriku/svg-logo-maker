## Description
The SVG Logo Maker is a Node.js command-line application that enables users to generate a simple logo for their projects. The application prompts users to enter text (up to three characters), choose a text color, select a shape (circle, square, or triangle), and specify the shape's color. It then creates an SVG file named `logo.svg` with the provided specifications.
